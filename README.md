# PowerBI-reports


Hi,

This repository is all about sharing my educational work with PowerBI. I will attach reports and photos of the reports that I have made in PowerBI.

All the reports I am sharing as PDF file as I do not have premium subscription of PowerBI. 
Access Reports using below URL : 

**Crime Data Analysis: ** 
https://github.com/Samarth403/PowerBI-reports/blob/main/Crime%20data%20analysis.pdf

**TTC Bus delay Report : **
https://github.com/Samarth403/PowerBI-reports/blob/main/TTC%20bus%20delay%20report.pdf

Apart from that, All the reports are interactive in PowerBI as it will be in PDF format in here so that will looks static.

Suggestion: TTC delay report is my report after i learned PowerBI perfectly. You will find it more intersting.

Thank you
